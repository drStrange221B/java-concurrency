What is visibility?
Bound to the way multicore CPUs works
What is the happens before link
What does volatile mean
The impact of false sharing on code

Synchronization and Visibility

Happens Before link
A "happens before" link exist between all synchronized or volatile write operations and
All synchronized or volatile read operations that follows.


How to write Correct Concurrent Code?
1) Check for race conditions
   - They occur on fields (not variables/parameters)
   - 2 Threads are reading/writing a given field
2) Check for the happens-before link
   - Are the read/write volatile?
   - Are they synchronized?
   - if not, there is a probably bug
3) Synchronized or volatile?
   - Synchronized = atomicity
   - Volatile = visibility
